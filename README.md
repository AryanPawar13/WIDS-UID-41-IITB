## Winter in Data Science Project UID 41: Stock Price Prediction with LSTM Networks

### Predicting stock prices is a complex task influenced by economic, market, and company-specific factors. This project explores the use of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), for stock price prediction. LSTMs excel in handling time-series data by capturing long-term dependencies and temporal patterns, making them ideal for financial forecasting.
